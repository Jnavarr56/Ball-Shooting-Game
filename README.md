### Description
This simple yet entertaining game is a basic shooter that relies on entirely on DOM manipulation.
The user is presented with instructions and the game start is triggered by moving any button.
Users play my moving across the screen and reaching alternating ends to get points, all the while shooting
and dodging obstacles that will result in a loss in they touch the user.

The inspiration came from playing around with divs and triggering element creation on keydown events.
